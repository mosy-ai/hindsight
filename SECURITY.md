# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for
receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| latest  | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to the maintainers privately.
You can do this by opening a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight/security/advisories/new).

You will receive a response from us within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed,
we will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity but
typically within a few days.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages
